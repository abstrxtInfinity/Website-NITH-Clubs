                <p>The Robotics society of NITH is a community of students who toil to trigger the interest in robotics among the students of the institute and also provide a platform to the student who have passion to do some great work and have innovative ideas. Each member of the society work in hand in hand, share their knowledge in the field of their expertise. Robotic society was initiated way back in 2015 under the supervision of Prof. Rajesh Sharma (Department of Mechanical Engineering), with the solitary objective of participating in the ROBOCON competition. But over the years it has spread its wings. We have well defined goals, an organized and disciplined work structure and motivated members who work with great zeal and energy. External members of the society are provided with a workspace, tools and other amenities to let their imagination ride. </p>
